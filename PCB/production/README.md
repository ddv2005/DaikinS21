This is 3rd generation design that works with WESMO D1 Mini ESP32 clones like https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08PNWB81Z/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Unlike the original design, I used a 5 volt step down converter and a TI level shifter 3.3v<->5v that should works with most units.
Board designed in EasyEDA for jlcpcb.com production. Jlcpcb production cost about $55 for 10 boards that much cheaper than original Faikon boards because of cheap single side assembly.
